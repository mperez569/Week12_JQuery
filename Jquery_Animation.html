                    JQuery is a library of the JavaScript functions that you are most likely 
                    to need as you develop a WebSite
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2><a href = "#">Why do we use JQuery?</a></h2>
            <div class = "hidden">
                <p>
                    I use JQuery to explore and learn more about Web Development in JavaScript.
                    Another reason why I use it is because as a class, we work together using it.
                    And finally, It gets you more in less time

            <h2><a href = "#">What is harder to learn: JQuery or JavaScript?</a></h2>
            <div class = "hidden">
                <p>
                    Both are challenging to learn, but it is harder to learn JQuery because you need to understand how to use JavaScript.
                    JS is a prerequisite to learning JQuery. But once you learn one of them, it'll be easier to learn to other one.
